# Competitive-Coding-Problems
Coding problems that I solve in different problem solving platforms like Hackerrank, Codeforces, Codingame, Codewars, Codechef, Excercism, Topcoder etc.

I will create folders for each website and files containing th title and serial number of the problem.
Not all of them are going to be 100% original code. some are definitely going to be collected codes, but I will not put anythng that I don't understand myself. I'll try to comment every details as much as possible.
